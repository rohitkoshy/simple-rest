    This is the minimal implementation that passes the current tests.
    Running the code coverage tool will confirm 100% branch coverage
    for the RpnCalculator.

    Additional tests are required to handle more complex scenarios.
    For instance, given the following scenario
        Scenario: Error occurs when there are not enough operands on the stack
            Given the stack has no operands
            When I press plus
            Then an error should occur saying "Not enough operands for operation"
    This scenario would necessitate implementing the corresponding validation
    in the "plus" operation.
